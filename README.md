"DESCRIPTION":Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that applies artistic styles to images while preserving content. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), NST extracts features from an original image and a chosen style, blending them to create visually unique artwork. It's widely used in digital creativity and AI-generated art.
